# bld.gasdet.f_11_ENRC-Plots
These are the plots where we bounded the points to be E3, from run 72, E2 (pts between  2.3 - 4.3) and E1 (3.6 - 5.6).
From these point that satisfied these condition the gasDetection values were found. Then the Median of these values was found and
the points were separated into two bins: one where the pts were bigger than the gasDet median and another where the pts were bigger.
Other branches include normalized plots of gasDet values with other bounds.
